#Off Screen Navs

This little repository is a responsive pattern for off screen navigation to both sides of the main content, very much like the Facebook app on iPhone (as it stands at this point in time).

[Here's a link to the demo](http://meteoracle.github.io/off-screen-navs/).

Feel free to grab this and play around with it. It's very basic and currently only tested in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

This was inspired by http://jasonweaver.name/lab/offcanvas/technical/, http://codepen.io/sturobson/pen/rAoBh and http://codepen.io/bradfrost/full/IEBrz, so a massive thanks goes to @mrJasonWeaver, @StuRobson and @brad_frost.
