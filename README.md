#Off Screen Navs

This little repository is a responsive pattern for off screen navigation to both sides of the main content, very mush like the Facebook appon iPhone (as it stands at this point in time).

Feel free to grab this and play around with it. IT's very basic and currently only test in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

This was inspired by http://jasonweaver.name/lab/offcanvas/technical/, http://codepen.io/sturobson/pen/rAoBh and http://codepen.io/bradfrost/full/IEBrz, so thanks to @mrJasonWeaver, @StuRobson and @brad_frost.
